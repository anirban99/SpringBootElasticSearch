We have 90 minutes, Mr. Young \nwill be hosting us to lunch during our meeting.  Joe Lemieux, CEO, is \nunavailable only because his calendar just didn't match up with your near \nterm available dates.  My strong bias is that the sooner we have an \nopportunity to connect at the top the better, especially given our drive to \nclose in Q-3.\n\nIn addition to coordinating logistics, I will get briefing packets to your \noffices Monday describing the proposed transaction, deal related issues \n(details are not likely to come up during the meeting), key O-I personnel \nbios, and general information about O-I and its current business, including \nsummary outside financial analysis.\n\nRegards,\nMichael\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "mid" : "11837032.1075840285704.JavaMail.evans@thyme", "fpath" : "enron_mail_20110402/maildir/lay-k/_sent/105.", "bcc" : [ "leticia.smith@enron.com" ], "to" : [ "michael.mann@enron.com" ], "replyto" : null, "ctype" : "text/plain; charset=us-ascii", "fname" : "105.", "date" : "2000-08-10 01:58:00-07:00", "folder" : "_sent", "subject" : "Re: Owens-Illinois Meeting" },
